Sources and methodology:

1. Media articles:
	
	Often the headlines are incorrect, misleading, or only say what the plea offense was. I read through them and for the offense data, I put what they ACTUALLY did. Example:

	"Officer arrested for assault"

	What it doesn't say in the headline, but much further into the article, is that it was sexual assault(does not say what type) on a 5 year old girl. So I put "sexual assault on 5 yo f". 
	
	"Police officer arrested for assault"
	
	When it was actually: 8 counts of false imprisonment by violence or deceit, 3 counts of criminal threats, 2 counts of domestic battery with corporal injury, 2 counts of aggravated assault, 1 count of dissuading a witness by force or threat and 1 count of vandalism.
	
	"Former Iowa police officer charged in assault"
	
	When it was actually: sexual abuse and extortion.
	
	I hope you are starting to see the pattern of how police bulletin board media outlets try to obfuscate and misrepresent information for those police, which works exceptionally well for people that do not read articles but instead share the headline. "Charged in assault" sounds much less severe than "charged with sexual abuse and extortion".

2. The NDI(National Decertification Index):

	In the opening paragraph of the NDI About page: "Inclusion in the database does not necessarily preclude any individual from appointment as an officer." This devalues certification.

3. The Henry A. Wallace Police Crime Database:

	This is tedious because it gives no officer names. I cross reference with date/offense/location to make sure that I don't already have that officer listed by name. There will be redundancy. I do my best to be thorough. If you find errors, bring it to my attention as soon as possible.

4. ResearchGate style platforms. Example:

	Courtney G. Lee, More than Just Collateral Damage: Pet Shootings by Police, 17 U.N.H. L. Rev. 171 (2018) Abstract excerpt: "The Department of Justice estimates that American police officers shoot 10,000 pet dogs in the line of duty each year. It is impossible to ascertain a reliable number, however, because most law enforcement agencies do not maintain accurate records of animal killings."
	
	I cannot put 10,000 lines of DOMESTIC animal cruelty/killing unless I have the names or officer numbers. Just know that many of the blue stripe bandits you love and revere have used the "I was afraid for my life" excuse to harm another being. See: Enzo the dog in Lodi, CA.
		
	I also do not have data of the blue stripe bandits that torture, maim, and/or kill wildlife. Only the most egregious and with video evidence usually get attention. You know how police love saying, "Crime is actually higher than it appears because of the things that don't get reported/charged"? Same applies. See: Maine police beat porcupines to death for snapchat.
	
5. Other OSINT such as court documents(the ones I don't have to pay the already luxurious living state employees to read), disciplinary reports such as (https://www.honolulupd.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HPD-2022-Legislative-Report.pdf), social media videos that get no mainstream media attention, and DOJ press releases.

6. My personal experiences with law enforcement. Examples:

	Taylor Reynolds(maine police) jumped me for not using a sidewalk ON A STREET WITH NO SIDEWALK and telling him "fuck you" for demanding I do so (https://www.tiktok.com/@sixie6e/video/7178950341675814190)
	
	Brian Martin(oklahoma police/jttf) offered to let me beat the fuck out of their target upon arrest (https://www.tiktok.com/@sixie6e/video/7191523163640040750) many of us would like to punish killers and child predators with violence and/or dehumanization but that would make us like them. Permitting it to happen to one accused opens the door for it to happen to all accused. See: Halden Prison, Norway.
	
	Luke Martin(maine state police) arrested me for calling maine state police(only once) and saying that he was militant, enforcing double standards. Had I chose to file a report, I would not have been arrested (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODKj900OwGk). 
	
	Jeff Boudreau(maine k9 sheriff) tried to convince me to leave the country while on bail, and falsely arrested me (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PyxJnlJV3l8) && (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9evRtQAp-o).

What if the officers weren't convicted? As stated in section 1 about plea bargains, they usually are not. Often witnesses do not want to go against them in court, the victims are minors, they resign and move(often to enlist in another law enforcement agency), and judges are not quick to rule against their militant enforcers. Notice when an officer does something perceived as heroic, it counts for all police but when one beats animals or children to death it counts against only that officer. Keep trying to make excuses for the blue stripe bandits' gang flag, though...
