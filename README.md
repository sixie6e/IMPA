Sources and methodology:

1. Media articles:
	
	Often the headlines are incorrect, misleading, or only say what the plea offense was. I read through them and for the offense data, I put what they ACTUALLY did. Example:

	"Officer arrested for assault"

	What it doesn't say in the headline, but much further into the article, is that it was sexual assault on a 5 year old girl. So I put "sexual assault on 5 yo f".

2. The Henry A. Wallace Police Crime Database:

	This is tedious because it gives no officer names. I cross reference with date/offense/location to make sure that I don't already have that officer listed by name. There will be redundancy but I do my best to be thorough. If you find errors, bring it to my attention as soon as possible. Currently, I am going alphabetically by state for each charge category.

3. My personal experiences with law enforcement.

	Example: Taylor Reynolds(police) jumped me for not using a sidewalk ON A STREET WITH NO SIDEWALK and telling him "fuck you" for demanding I do so (https://www.tiktok.com/@sixie6e/video/7178950341675814190)
	
	Jeff Boudreau(k9 sheriff) falsely arrested me and tried to convince me to leave the country while on bail (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PyxJnlJV3l8)
	
4. Other OSINT such as court documents(the ones I don't have to pay the already luxurious living state employees to read), disciplinary reports such as (https://www.honolulupd.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HPD-2022-Legislative-Report.pdf), social media videos that get no mainstream media attention, and DOJ press releases.

What if the officers weren't convicted? As stated in section 1 about plea bargains, they usually are not. Often witnesses do not want to go against them in court, the victims are minors, they resign and move(often to enlist in another law enforcement agency), and judges are not quick to rule against their militant enforcers. Keep trying to make excuses for the blue stripe gang flag, though. The oppressor would not be so strong if he did not have so many accomplices among the oppressed.
